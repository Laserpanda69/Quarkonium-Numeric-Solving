A Charminingly Simple Method for Predicting Quarkonium Mass
Experimental Period: October 20, 2022 - March 25, 2023

Quarkonium is a bound state of a heavy quark and its antiquark, charm quarks making charmonium and bottom quarks making bottomonium.
These quarkonia can be described by Schrodinger's equation and have its properties analysed just like any other quantum mechanical system.
This includes its binding energy eigenvalue, when can be found numerically by solving a pair of coupled ODEs derived from Schrodinger's at some lower bound of the eigenvalue, and increasing this value until the correct wavefunction behaviour is exhibited.
Then the eigenvalue is added to the mass of the constituent quark masses to reproduce the mass of states up to 2S with good agreement using a number of models for the inter quark potential, $M_{\eta_c(1S)} = 2.984GeV, M_{h_c(1P)} = 3.462GeV, M_{\eta_c'(2S)} = 3.675GeV$.
Due to good agreement with experimental masses, masses of unmeasured states can be predicted with a sense of validity, $M_{h_c'(2P)} = 4.003GeV, M_{\eta_c''(3S)} = 4.190GeV$.
This method works well, reproducing masses with good agreement, for one parameter potential models, however struggles with multi-parameter models due to time complexity, and is also sensitive to numerical instability due to small numbers in computer memory.
